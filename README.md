# rv23-experiments

Experiments from the paper "Monitoring Hyperproperties With Prefix Transducers" accepted at RV'23

## Data from the paper

The CSV files that were generated by our experiments are in the folder `csv_from_paper`.
In the rest of this README, we describe how to generate the CSV files.

## Docker
TBD

## Building without Docker

### Requirements
TBD

#### Requirements for plotting the results
TBD

### Configuration & Build

```shell
# clone the repo
git checkout https://github.com/ista-vamos/rv23-experiments
cd rv23-experiments

# initialize and build vamos-buffers
git submodule update --init -- vamos-buffers
cd vamos-buffers
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
cd -

# configure and build the project
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

In the top level directory is the script `run.sh` that takes as an argument either
`rand` to run experiments on random traces, or `1t` to run experiments on
multiple instances of the same trace. So run the experiments as follows:

```
./run.sh rand
./run.sh 1t
```

By default, the script repeats the experiments 10 times (can be modified by changing
the `REP` variable in the script). If you run the script multiple times, it will
prompt the user if the old results should be overwritten or not.

The result of the experiments will be printed to the standard output and also
saved into `results_rand.csv` and `results_1t.csv`.

### Customizing

As stated above, the number of repetitions of the experiments can be set by the
`REP` variable in the script `run.sh`. There is also the variable `NPROC`
that controls how many processes should be run in parallel.
By default, it is empty which means that the script should detect the number of cores
and use a suitable number of processes. You can set this variable to a number
of processes that you want to use.

## Plotting the results

There is a script `plot.sh` that takes the generated CSV files and generates plots
to `plot-rand.pdf` and `plot-1t.pdf`. Simply run it as

```
./plot.sh
```

You can use it also to re-generate the plots from the paper on the data in `csv_from_paper`:

```
./plot.sh paper
```
